A responsive marketing website recreated from a third-party mockup using HTML and CSS, featuring clean navigation, a strong call-to-action, and organized feature sections—demonstrating my ability to turn visual designs into fully functional interfaces.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img alt="HTML5 Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-000000?style=flat&logo=HTML5"></a>

I first started with the structure of the website so I had a good idea of what the foundation will look like. From what I gleamed, there were 3 major sections of the website the I had to tackle and focus on one by one. The first section included the navigation bar, which I organized using floats to align the elements neatly across the top. After that, I positioned the rest of the elements normally and styled them using padding, margins, and spacing to keep everything clean and readable.

The second section involved floating both the search bar area and the picture to the right of it. I made each section that both resided separately in float by around 50% since they both took up both halves of the website. The for the search bar, I had to float the search bar and button next to each other to make sure that they are form fitted while putting the appropriate text on top and on the bottom of them to match the website vibe.

The last section was a bit of a puzzle that I solved using some basic logic. Each feature section had their own content contained in their square with an icon and link. There were four total sections in total, so I made the feature boxes around 23% in width to account for the small amount of margin to make them spaced correctly. 

## Optimizations
A small change I made was amongst features 1 & 3. There was a different icon for feature 3 that wasn't clear like the icons for the other features. I put that shady icon there, but I didn't like it. The website was great, and I felt like putting that icon would sour the entire website since it looked uncouth and unprofessional. So I opted to use the icon from feature 1, since both feature 1 and 3 had circle icons which helped to make it fit better and make the website appealing to the eye.
