# Ayesha Hair Salon
A stylish, responsive landing page for a fictional hair salon, Ayesha, built with HTML/CSS from a third-party mockup. Includes a clean navigation bar, service highlights, promotional sections, and a gallery—perfect for showcasing service-based businesses.

When I started this project, I decided to approach it differently. Instead of building the full layout first and styling afterward, I styled each section as I built it. This helped me stay in flow, push myself to work faster, and get used to creating under pressure—something I want to improve long-term. I identified four major parts of the website to focus on: the navigation bar, the booking section for blonde highlights, the services section, and the “momentum in style” section.

#### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar consisted of three main parts: the site title, the navigation links, and the “Book Online” button. I initially set each of these sections to 33.3% width and floated them to align horizontally. Because the second section contained eight navigation elements, I later adjusted the layout: the first and third sections were reduced to 20% width each, giving the center section 60% width. Each navigation item inside that center section was sized at 12.5% so all eight items fit cleanly across the bar. Floats, spacing, and padding helped me keep everything aligned and readable.

#### Blonde Highlights Booking Section
This section included informational content and discounts on the left, with a featured image on the right. Since the design splits the layout evenly, I set both sides to roughly 50% width using floats. The left side included a button linking to the services, along with details about booking online. I designed this area to stand out visually, serving as a strong entry point for customers looking to elevate their style.

#### Services Provided
The services section showcased three feature blocks centered in the page. Each feature included an icon, a title, and descriptive text, all contained within a square box. With three features in total, I sized each block at about 30% width so they would fit neatly inside a 60% container. This created balanced spacing, maintained symmetry, and kept the layout consistent with the intended design.

#### Momentum Section
The momentum section required floating both the text and the accompanying image to the right, again using a 50/50 layout split. I reused the button styling from the navigation bar to keep visual consistency across the site. This section ties everything together, reinforcing the project’s theme of helping customers build confidence and momentum through style.


## Lessons Learned:
Throughout this project, I continued to strengthen my understanding of CSS floats, especially when working through more complex layout patterns. These challenges pushed me to think differently about structure and spacing, and they helped me become more confident in handling traditional layout techniques. Building this way is important for me because I want to stay versatile in the kinds of websites I create—both for future personal projects and for any professional work where adaptable front-end skills are essential.
